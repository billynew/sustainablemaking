Rapid prototyping has been a major research thrust in HCI and UIST, but the sustainability impact of rapid prototyping has not been thoroughly discussed.

This workshop will offer the UIST community its first opportunity to discuss the sustainability challenges and the research opportunities associated with sustainable rapid prototyping. We will explore key issues such as waste generation from intermediate prototypes, strategies for using sustainable materials, and circular prototyping (e.g., promoting the reuse of components). Additionally, we'll delve into knowledge-sharing infrastructures like open-sourcing hardware. Our objective is to pinpoint potential HCI research avenues that promote a more sustainable 'making' environment both inside labs and in wider contexts.


## Background and Goal
Over the past decades, democratized fabrication and electronic toolkits have proven to be a monumental driving force for innovation. Tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, Arduino, and CircuitPython are now common in research labs and makerspaces, drastically reducing the innovation cycle. However, this ease in rapid design iteration has introduced notable sustainability challenges.

The development of new products through rapid prototyping inevitably produces a large number of intermediate prototypes, such as 3D printed structures and custom PCBs. These intermediate prototypes are created to verify various aspects of our design but are not utilized in subsequent iterations—these one-off prototypes leave behind a significant amount of waste. Unfortunately, currently, there are no established ways to re-purpose or minimize the waste generated in this process. Additionally, bulk order leftovers, under optimized space management, and underdeveloped knowledge sharing infrastructures are also contributing to sustainability issues in various aspects of rapid prototyping.

This workshop aims to explore the sustainability issues linked with rapid prototyping and pinpoint HCI research paths for more sustainable "making" processes.

## Agenda
The workshop will consist of keynotes, demos, hands-on building, and brainstorming sessions, divided into six distinct activities.

#### Activity 1 Opening and short keynotes (9:00-10:00)
Our workshop begins with a short introductory session, followed by three 20-minute keynotes. Potential topics range from research projects on new materials, tools, and systems for rapid prototyping, to their own perspectives on sustainable making. We expect to host three keynote speakers and have already sent out invitations to Prof. Eric Paulos, Prof. Gregory Abowd, and Prof. Kristin Williams; we are currently awaiting confirmation.

#### Activity 2 Demo Presenting current sustainability practice (10:00- 11:00). 

Primed by the keynotes, the organizers will initiate a modified speed-dating activity. In this activity, participants will meet in pairs or triads for 15 minutes before forming new groups. During these meetings, participants will present and demo their own hardware prototypes to each other, discussing the design process and any sustainability issues that arose during development. This format is designed to encourage maximum interaction among participants.

#### Activity 3 Hands-on building Reflecting on the prototyping process by making a phone stabilizer (11:00-12:30). 

In this activity, participants will be divided into groups of 4-5 people to conduct a hands-on mini-project: building a 2-axis phone camera gimbal. The organizers will provide each group with materials such as laser-cut acrylics, cardboard, Play-Doh, wire meshes, as well as basic crafting tools like scissors and hot glue. The goal is to encourage participants to reflect on this hands-on prototyping process and compare it with the more conventional digital prototyping processes they’re used to. Participants will be asked to document and reflect on their prototyping process in a shared document. The organizers will facilitate a 15-minute reflection session. Each group will discuss their workflow and any potential sustainability issues encountered during the prototyping phase.


#### Activity 4 - Brainstorming: Sustainability challenges in making (13:30-15:00). 

Reflecting on discussions from Activities 2 and 3, a brainstorming session will focus on challenges and opportunities for sustainable rapid prototyping. The audience will be divided into small groups, with each group having a set of prototypes from Activity 3 and a hypothetical tangible innovation project to facilitate the brainstorming. The design process, potential prototyping tools, and material waste will be suggested as the key discussion points. In the final 30 minutes, each group will present the identified sustainability challenges, as well as the design opportunities for sustainable making tools, systems, or practices.

#### Activity 5: Brainstorming: Sustainability challenges beyond individual (15:00-16:00). 

Participants will be reshuffled into new groups for this brainstorming session. The key discussion points will be on
project management, material management, and how physical materials, components, or prototypes can be reused on a larger scale. Participants are encouraged to reflect on their own lab or project management experience. Each group will present their findings in the final 15 minutes.

#### Activity 6: Summary and future plans (16:00-17:00). 

As the final activity, all participants will come together to map out the future of sustainable prototyping. Discussion items will include: (1) the list of key challenges to address, (2) the list of potential technical directions to pursue, (3) the methods to evaluate new sustainable
practices, and (4) the approaches to promote sustainable prototyping on a large scale.

## Post-Workshop Plans
We will prepare a webpage to document the discussions from the workshop. Distilled results may also be shared with the HCI community via a position article. We also plan to further build the community around sustainable making through the following mechanisms: 1) we will plan a new edition of this workshop either at CHI 2025 or at other venues such as the Dagstuhl seminar; 2) we will follow up with participants, seeking further online meetings and collaborations towards future research on this topic; 3) we may create monthly newsletters on recent research on this topic, sharing
them with the participants and with the broader HCI and maker community.
