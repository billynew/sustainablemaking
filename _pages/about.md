Rapid prototyping has been a major research thrust in HCI and UIST, but the sustainability impact of rapid prototyping has not been thoroughly discussed.

This workshop will offer the UIST community its first opportunity to discuss the sustainability challenges and the research opportunities associated with sustainable rapid prototyping. We will explore key issues such as waste generation from intermediate prototypes, strategies for using sustainable materials, and circular prototyping (e.g., promoting the reuse of components). Additionally, we'll delve into knowledge-sharing infrastructures like open-sourcing hardware. Our objective is to pinpoint potential HCI research avenues that promote a more sustainable 'making' environment both inside labs and in wider contexts.

**This workshop will be held on-site as part of UIST on Sunday, October 29th. To join us, register for our workshop during [UIST registration](https://web.cvent.com/event/084853b8-9ccc-43ee-8438-78e1a744b086/summary).** Note: you do not need to submit any work prior to joining! Participation is open to anyone as long as they register. 


## Background and Goal
Over the past decades, democratized fabrication and electronic toolkits have proven to be a monumental driving force for innovation. Tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, Arduino, and CircuitPython are now common in research labs and makerspaces, drastically reducing the innovation cycle. However, this ease in rapid design iteration has introduced notable sustainability challenges.

The development of new products through rapid prototyping inevitably produces a large number of intermediate prototypes, such as 3D printed structures and custom PCBs. These intermediate prototypes are created to verify various aspects of our design but are not utilized in subsequent iterations—these one-off prototypes leave behind a significant amount of waste. Unfortunately, currently, there are no established ways to re-purpose or minimize the waste generated in this process. Additionally, bulk order leftovers, under optimized space management, and underdeveloped knowledge sharing infrastructures are also contributing to sustainability issues in various aspects of rapid prototyping.

This workshop aims to explore the sustainability issues linked with rapid prototyping and pinpoint HCI research paths for more sustainable "making" processes.

## Agenda
The workshop will consist of keynotes, demos, hands-on building, and brainstorming sessions, divided into six distinct activities. (More details to follow!)

| -------- | ------- |
| Opening & Keynotes  | 9:00-10:00   |
| Speed-Networking Activity | 10:00-11:00     |
| Collaborative Making Activity    | 11:00-12:30    |
| LUNCH BREAK    | 12:30-13:30    |
| Brainstorm: Tools for sustainable making    | 13:30-15:00    |
| Brainstorm: Sustainable making at scale   | 15:00-16:00    |
| Closing & Future Plans | 16:00-17:00    |
