This workshop provides the first opportunity for the UIST community to discuss sustainability challenges and opportunities in rapid prototyping. We will discuss key issues such as waste generation from intermediate prototypes, strategies for sustainable materials, circular prototyping (e.g., promoting re-use of components), knowledge sharing infrastructures (e.g., open-sourcing hardware), and so forth. The goal is to identify potential HCI research directions that can foster a more sustainable "making" environment inside of labs and beyond.


# Background and goal
Over the past decades, democratized fabrication and electronic toolkits have proven to be a monumental driving force for innovation. Digital fabrication tools (e.g., 3D printers, laser cutters) and electronics toolkits (e.g., Arduino, CircuitPython), have become widespread in research labs and makerspaces. Enabling accessible
rapid prototyping has significantly shortened the innovation cycle. However, the ease with which rapid design iterations can be carried out ad hoc and in situ has also led to considerable sustainability
challenges that are often overlooked.

The development of new products through rapid prototyping inevitably produces a large number of intermediate prototypes, such as 3D printed structures and custom PCBs. These intermediate prototypes are created to verify various aspects of our design but are not utilized in subsequent iterationsâ€”these one-off prototypes
leave behind a significant amount of waste. Unfortunately, currently, there are no established ways to re-purpose or minimize the waste generated in this process. Additionally, bulk order leftovers, under optimized space management, and underdeveloped knowledge sharing infrastructures are also contributing to sustainability issues in various aspects of rapid prototyping.

In this workshop, we aim to understand the sustainability challenges associated with rapid prototyping and seek to identify potential HCI research directions toward more sustainable "making"
processes.

# Agenda
The workshop will consist of keynotes, demos, hands-on building, and brainstorming sessions, divided into six distinct activities.

## Activity 1 Opening and short keynotes
Our workshop begins with a short introductory session, followed by three
20-minute keynotes. Potential topics range from research projects
on new materials, tools, and systems for rapid prototyping, to their
own perspectives on sustainable making. We expect to host three
keynote speakers and have already sent out invitations to Prof. Eric Paulos, Prof. Gregory Abowd, and Prof. Kristin Williams; we are currently awaiting confirmation.

## Activity 2 Demo
Presenting current sustainability practice (10:00-
11:00). Primed by the keynotes, the organizers will initiate a modified speed-dating activity [4]. In this activity, participants will
meet in pairs or triads for 15 minutes before forming new groups.
During these meetings, participants will present and demo their
own hardware prototypes to each other, discussing the design process and any sustainability issues that arose during development.
This format is designed to encourage maximum interaction among
participants.
